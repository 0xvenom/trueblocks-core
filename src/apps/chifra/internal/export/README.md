## chifra export

The `chifra export` tools provides a major part of the functionality of the TrueBlocks system. Using the index of appearances created with `chifra scrape` and the list of transaction identifiers created with `chifra list`, `chifra export` completes the actual extraction of an address's transactional history from the node.

You may use `topics`, `fourbyte` values at the start of a transaction's input data, and/or a log's `source address` or `emitter` to filter the results.

You may also choose which portions of the Ethereum data structures (`--transactions`, `--logs`, `--traces`, etc.) as you wish.

By default, the results of the extraction are delivered to your console, however, you may export the results to any database (with a little bit of work). The format of the data, its content and its destination are up to you.

Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
