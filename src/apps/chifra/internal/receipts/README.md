## chifra receipts

`chifra receipts` returns the given transaction's receipt. You may specify multiple transaction identifiers per invocation.

The `--articulate` option fetches the ABI from each encountered smart contract (including those encountered in a trace--if the `--trace` option is enabled) to better describe the reported data.

Generally speaking, this tool is less useful than others as you may report the same data using `chifra transactions` and more focused data using `chifra logs`. It is included here for completeness, as the `receipt` is a fundamental data structure in Ethereum.

Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
